# The Art Of Computer Programming
[y]ea[h], I guess if you're planning to be a
professional programmer you can get away 
vithout touching Knuth's books at all, but
for whatever reason I like reading these books.
This is a project I've started of writing
algorithms and exercises from Knuth's books in
different languages, for the moment these are
the languages:
 - C++
 - Python
 - Perl
 - gas
 - nasm
 - mixal
 - C#
 - JavaScript
 - bash
 - elisp
 - go
 - java

It's fun and I hope to update this repository
frequently. These are the current algorithms:
 - 110E  - Euclid's algorithm.
 - 132P  - Print table of 500 primes.
 - 7212L - Lexicographic permutation generation.
