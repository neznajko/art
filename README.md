# The Art Of Computer Programming
[y]ea[h], I guess if you're planning to be a
professional programmer you can get away 
vithout touching Knuth's books at all, but
for whatever reason I like reading these books.
This is a project I've started of writing
algorithms and exercises from Knuth's books in

the languages:
a) C++
b) Python

d) gas
e) nasm
f) mixal
g) C#
h) JavaScript
i) bash
j) elisp
k) go
l) java

frequently. These are the current algorithms:
